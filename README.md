Please see [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to contribute to this project.


## Requirements

- [**Qt5**](https://www.qt.io/)
- [**libusb-1.0**](http://libusb.info/)


For developers on Ubuntu or other Debian-based distributions, appropriate versions of several of the required packages are unlikely to be installed by default.
As of Ubuntu 23.04 Lunar Lobster, the following command is recommended to find the packages required:
'''
sudo apt-get install -y cmake qtcreator qtbase5-dev qt5-qmake libusb-1.0-0-dev ament-cmake-googletest
'''

## Building

Building and testing is done through CMake:

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
make unittest
```


## Installation

CMake will install the application and *udev* rules using:

```
make install
```

The *udev* rule allows the USB access without *root* for the users of the `plugdev` group.


## Libusb Logging

Debug message logging of [*libusb*](https://libusb.sourceforge.io/api-1.0/) can be controlled by the `LIBUSB_DEBUG` variable (0: None, 1: Error, 2: Warning, 3: Info, 4: Debug).
