Plug is an alternative to the (discontinued) FUSE software. It allows to control the amplifier and organize presets.

Please see [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to contribute to this project.


## Requirements

- [**Qt6**](https://www.qt.io/)
- [**libusb-1.0**](http://libusb.info/)

For developers on Ubuntu or other Debian-based distributions, appropriate versions of several of the required packages are unlikely to be installed by default.
As of Ubuntu 24.04 Noble Numbat, the following command is recommended to find the packages required:
'''
sudo apt-get install -y cmake qtcreator qtbase6-dev qt6-qmake libusb-1.0-0-dev \
   cmake-googletest googletest libgtest-dev google-mock libgmock-dev
'''

## Building

Building and testing is done through CMake:

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
make unittest
```


## Installation

CMake will install the application and *udev* rules using:

```
make install
```

The *udev* rule allows the USB access without *root* for the users of the `plugdev` group.


## Libusb Logging

Debug message logging of [*libusb*](https://libusb.sourceforge.io/api-1.0/) can be controlled by the `LIBUSB_DEBUG` variable (0: None, 1: Error, 2: Warning, 3: Info, 4: Debug).
